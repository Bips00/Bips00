👋 Hi, I'm Bipasha Thakur

I am into computational bioinformatics research dedicated to study the intricate molecular rewiring 
of human microbiome protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks induced by ionizing radiation. 
My research integrates systems-level network biology, radiation biophysics, and microbial ecology 
to elucidate how environmental radiation perturbs microbiome-host molecular ecosystems—informing 
next-generation strategies in radioprotection, microbiome therapeutics, and personalized precision medicine.

By designing and implementing novel algorithmic frameworks that capture the dynamic topology and 
functional shifts of microbiome PPIs under radiation stress, I bridge multi-omic datasets with 
clinical phenotypes to reveal biomarkers and molecular pathways driving radiation-induced dysbiosis, 
immune modulation, and disease susceptibility.
